# Ocelot API Gateway Demo
This repository is a POC of simple and robust API gateway development using Ocelot and ASP.net Core

## Pre-requisites

You would need the following to be able to reproduce the demo:  

- .NET Core 2.0 or above

## Disclamer

This repository does not involve docker containers. However, you can try to check my other repository that contains sample that leverages Ocelot on top of Docker Containers and Docker Compose at the link below:
